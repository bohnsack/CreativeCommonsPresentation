This repository contains a presentation on Creative Commons I did for my grad
school research group.  It contains an overview of how Creative Commons works
and an example of programatic control of CC-licensed entities.  The programatic
control is implemented in Ruby and contains a test suite that can be used to
show that it's implemented correctly.

- The presentation is in Beamer/LaTeX.  To build, given a machine setup to
  typeset this sort of thing, just type "make" in the current directory.

- Code is in the code/ directory
    - cc_licensed.rb is a ruby module that can be mixed-in to other classes to
      gain behavior of a CC-licensed entity
    - book.rb is a simple class representing a book that gets the module
      defined in cc_licensed.rb mixed into it.
    - tests are in code/test/ts_cc.rb.  You can run them by typing "rake" in
      the code/ directory.
